##  Preliminary Requirement Analysis

### Functional requirements & Features

#### Event Center

##### Participant

Participants need a simple way to find events that match their interests and also want access to clear, current information about the event, such as where and when it is. So, our software gives them a tool to discover events that lets them search and choose what they're interested in, along with giving them detailed information about the event, like maps and when it's happening.

##### Organizer

Organizers need an all-in-one place to easily share their events and also want to be able to update event details quickly to make sure the information is correct and up-to-date for participants. Our solution provides organizers with a straightforward platform for sharing events and making changes to the details, making it easier to manage the event and engage with participants.

#### Event Booking

##### Participant

Participants want an easy and straightforward process to sign up for events. They also want to see the details they've submitted and get an idea of how many people are expected to join. To meet these needs, we provide a simple event booking system. This lets participants easily enter their details, check their sign-up status, and see how many people are expected to attend.

##### Organizer

Organizers need a simple way to keep track of who has signed up for their events and to check attendees in efficiently. Our platform offers tools that help organizers keep an eye on bookings and carry out group check-ins. This makes it easier to manage who's coming to the event.

#### Messaging System

##### Participant

Participants want an easy and fast way to talk to event organizers and other attendees, and to get updates on any changes to the event. Our messaging system offers instant notification of changes to booked activities, which allows participants to quickly understand the latest situation and make decisions.

##### Organizer

Organizers stress the need to send out event updates quickly and answer any questions from participants efficiently. Our system is equipped with tools for sending notifications to many people at once, conducting private and group chats to address questions, and creating quick replies. This setup helps organizers communicate effectively with participants.

#### Forum System

Both participants and organizers see the benefit of having a space where they can share and discuss events.  To meet this need, we offer a forum system.  Here, users can write posts, leave comments, and share photos and videos.  This creates an active community focused on sharing experiences and feedback about events.

#### User Space

GalaGuide provides a personal dashboard for users, making it easy to keep track of and manage their activities.  This includes a record of past events, favorite picks, payments, and future bookings.  It helps users monitor their event participation and money spent.  Users can also personalize their profiles and settings, like how they receive notifications or manage their privacy.  This tailored and user-friendly setup ensures a smooth experience, helping everyone make the most of their time with GalaGuide, in line with our commitment to ease and customization.

#### Chat Room

##### Private Chat

Users can have one-on-one conversations by clicking on someone's avatar and sending them a private message. This feature allows for personal and direct communication within the platform.

##### Group Chat

Users can create or join groups. When a message is sent in a group, it's instantly shared with all online members. This enables collective discussions and information sharing among users who share similar interests.

#### AI Assistant

Gal, the GalaGuide's intelligent assistant, revolutionizes user interaction with databases by interpreting natural language into SQL queries. It utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technology to understand what users mean in everyday language, converting these understandings into SQL commands to retrieve the needed information. This innovative approach makes it easier for those without technical skills to access databases and improves with every interaction, becoming more accurate in understanding and responding to user queries. Gal is integrated into GalaGuide, offering a simple way for users to ask various questions, from seeking local event recommendations to performing detailed data analyses, making getting information straightforward and effective.

#### Events Exploring and Recommendation System

Participants can find events tailored to their interests and schedules through an automated recommendation system. This system suggests events based on users' preferences and available times, greatly improving the process of discovering new events.

#### Currency System

Guiro is the virtual currency within GalaGuide. Users can earn guiros through several activities:

- Checking in daily.
- Sharing their experiences about events they've attended.
- Contributing to the GalaGuide community in various ways.

## AI Usage

For the tasks of conducting preliminary requirement analysis, generating user stories, and creating issues or tasks, we incorporated AI as a tool for further optimization after completing these tasks manually. Our approach was to leverage AI judiciously, enhancing our processes without becoming overly reliant on it.

### Preliminary Requirement Analysis

In the task of identifying functional and non-functional requirements, AI proved to be highly effective. After our team outlined the initial set of requirements, we utilized AI to integrate these disparate features and offer further suggestions. This AI involvement enabled us to consolidate human-generated ideas into a more cohesive and comprehensive set of requirements, demonstrating AI's strength in synthesizing and enhancing human input.

### Generating User Stories

When it came to directly generating user stories using AI, the results were not satisfactory due to the lack of a genuine campus experience foundation. However, AI significantly contributed when used to role-play based on user stories already proposed by humans. By simulating conversations between different campus personas, AI helped us better understand the emphasis of user needs, refining our approach. This method of engaging AI for role-playing provided valuable insights and adjustments to our initial ideas.

### Generating Issues or Tasks

Directly generating tasks and issues with AI did not yield positive outcomes, as this process heavily depends on the team's shared understanding and individual perspectives. Nevertheless, AI became highly beneficial when tasked with providing opinions on already identified tasks and issues from various roles, such as a project manager, a software developer, or an investor. This application of AI allowed us to view our project through different lenses, offering diverse perspectives that enriched our decision-making and prioritization processes.

In summary, while AI was instrumental in optimizing certain aspects of our project development, its utility was maximized when used to augment human-led activities rather than replace them. This balanced approach ensured that AI's capabilities were harnessed to refine and enhance our work, grounded in the real-world context and collective expertise of our team.
